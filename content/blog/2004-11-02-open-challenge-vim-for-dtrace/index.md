Inspired by the [Ansari X-Prize](http://www.xprize.org/), I thought I'd start issuing open challenges to the community of DTrace and Solaris users. This isn't because I hate you, or even because I like you necessarily: it's because I'm lazy. Or if not lazy, at least busy. So my first open challenge is this:

### vim for .d files

The following are required of a winning entry

- syntax hi-lighting of keywords, built-in functions, aggregations, etc.
- smart commenting (when I hit return I want `' \* '`)
- other fancy stuff
- easy for me to install (again, I'm lazy, impatient, busy, etc.)

There's no prize, but I'll certainly voice my appreciation as loudly as appropriate. Submissions for emacs will be accepted, but I will extoll its virtues with less passion. If this works out, I'll come up with tougher challenges and maybe real prizes. In some not-too-distant future, I hope to get OpenSolaris running on my TiVo -- I promise a prize for that :-)
