Next week I'll be continuing the DTrace world tour in LA and San Diego (see [Matt's](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/mingenthron) [announcement](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/mingenthron?entry=announcement_adam_leventhal_scheduled_in)). On Monday, August 15 from 7pm-9pm I'll be talk to the [Unix Users' Group](http://www.bolthole.com/uuala/) here:  
Sun Office in El Segundo  
222 N. Sepulveda Blvd., 10th Floor  
El Segundo, CA 90245  

My plan is to demonstrate DTrace (including the recent advancements in [Java](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/dtrace_presentation_at_javaone) and [php](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bmc?entry=dtrace_and_php_demonstrated)) and talk a bit about OpenSolaris. If there's anything in particular you'd like to hear about, feel free to leave a comment or just bring your question Monday night. Hope to see you there.
