[eWEEK](http://www.eweek.com) has an [article on DTrace](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1626474,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03129TX1K0000612). The analysis of DTrace is pretty accurate, but they refer opaquely to [Bryan](http://blogs.sun.com/bmc) and me as "Sun officials". I'm looking forward to their in-depth comparison of DTrace and DProbes...
