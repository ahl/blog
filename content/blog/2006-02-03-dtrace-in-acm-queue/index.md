While usually a shameless self-promoter, Bryan has been conspicuously silent about [his recent article](http://www.acmqueue.org/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=361) in ACM Queue. It's quite good, and goes beyond what has previously been written about [DTrace](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/) in discussing its origins, the landscape of the problem, and some fundamental innovations embodied in DTrace -- information that may have been too obscure in [our USENIX paper](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace/dtrace_usenix.pdf) (according to at least one Stanford professor).
