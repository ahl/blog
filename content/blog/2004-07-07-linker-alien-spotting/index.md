After much cajoling, self-described linker alien Rod Evans has joined the fray with his own [weblog](http://blogs.sun.com/rie). As [Bryan Cantrill](http://blogs.sun.com/bmc) and I will assert again and again, the linker is one of the finest pieces of engineering in all of Solaris, and the Linkers and Libraries Guide is one of the finest pieces of documentation -- and it's written by Rod and his fellow linker aliens. The linker has many many subtle and useful features. See what Rod has to say about it, and go ask him questions -- I know I'm excited to see what Rod up his sleeve.
