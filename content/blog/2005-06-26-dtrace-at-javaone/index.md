I'll be at JavaOne this week demonstrating the new Java/DTrace mash-up. At Monday morning's keynote, I get a 100 second talk-within-a-talk (which itself is a talk-within-a-talk). On Monday evening, [Stephen](http://blogs.sun.com/sch), [Mike](http://blogs.sun.com/mws), [Bryan](http://blogs.sun.com/bmc), and I (and possibly some other Solaris folks) will be holding a BoF on OpenSolaris, DTrace and what they mean for Java. We'll be in Golden Gate B1 at the Marriott Hotel from 7:30pm to 8:30pm. I'll be hanging around one of the DTrace or Solaris booths whenever I can to watch Jarod Jenson [getting performance wins in Java applications](http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/javaone_challenge.jsp) and giving away iPods if he can't (I'm betting he gives away between zero and one iPods). Feel free to come by the booth or stop me in the halls for a demo or to talk about DTrace.
