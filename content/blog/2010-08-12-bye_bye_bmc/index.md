I've been expecting this automated mail for a while now, but it was disheartening nonetheless:

As one of the moderators of the DTrace discussion list, I see people subscribe and unsubscribe. Bryan has, of course, [left Oracle](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2010/07/25/good-bye-sun/) and [joined Joyent](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2010/07/30/hello-joyent/) to be their [VP of engineering](http://www.joyent.com/2010/07/joyent-names-bryan-cantrill-vice-president-of-engineering/).

Bryan is a terrific engineer, and I count myself lucky to have worked with him for the past nine years first on DTrace and then on Fishworks. He taught me many things, but perhaps most important was his holistic view of engineering that encompasses all aspects of making a product successful including docs, pricing, talks, papers, and, of course, excellent code. Now Bryan is off to [cut through the layers software that make up the cloud](http://storagemojo.com/2010/08/05/clouds-app-killer). Far from leaving the DTrace community, he's going to take DTrace to new places and I look forward to seeing the fruits of his labor as he sinks his teeth into a new onion of abstractions.

... and, Robin, Bryan's certainly a smart guy, but "[the smart guy behind Dtrace](http://storagemojo.com/2010/08/05/clouds-app-killer) \[sic\]"?? Just don't refer to me and [Mike](http://blogs.sun.com/mws) as "the dumb guys behind DTrace" okay?
