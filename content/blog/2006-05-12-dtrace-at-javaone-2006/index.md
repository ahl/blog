At last year's JavaOne, [DTrace](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/) enjoyed some modicum of celebrity, being featured in [a keynote](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/dtrace_in_the_javaone_keynote), [a session](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/dtrace_presentation_at_javaone), and [the DTrace challenge](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/crazy_dtrace_java_challenge). The session was attended by about 1,000 people (out of about 10,000 at the conference), and the DTrace Challenge -- which promised to find a performance win in Java applications brought to us or fork over an iPod -- went an [impressive 15 for 16](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/chrisra?entry=solaris_performance_challenge_at_javaone) (and that one outlier was a trivial 200 line program -- we've added a 2,000 line minimum this year).

Building on that success, Jarod Jenson and I are giving an updated [session on DTrace for Java](https://www28.cplan.com/javaone06_cv_124_1/session_details.jsp?isid=277311&ilocation_id=124-1&ilanguage=english) Thursday 5/18 2:45-3:45 in the Moscone Center Gateway 102/103. We'll be giving a similar introduction to DTrace and to using DTrace on Java as at last year's talk, and showing off some of the improvements we've made in the past year. Jarod's also manning the [DTrace Challenge](http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/javaone_challenge.jsp) again this year so get your Java application onto a USB key, CD or whatever, and bring it by booth 739; if he can't make it go faster you'll get an iPod, but if you were hoping for an iPod rather than a performance win prepare to be disappointed. Angelo Rajadurai and Peter Karlsson are also giving a [hands on lab](https://www28.cplan.com/javaone06_cv_124_1/session_details.jsp?isid=279365&ilocation_id=124-1&ilanguage=english) on using DTrace to examine Java applications (Friday 5/19 1:15-2:15 Moscone Center Hall E 130/131) so be sure to sign up for that if you want to get your hands dirty with the stuff we talk about at our session.
