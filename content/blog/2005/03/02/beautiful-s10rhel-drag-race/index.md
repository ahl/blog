Network World Fusion has an [article](http://www.nwfusion.com/reviews/2005/022805solaristest.html) comparing Solaris 10 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.0 (the [self-proclaimed](http://www.redhat.com/about/presscenter/2005/press_rhel4.html) Solaris killer. The sweetest part of this article is the graph showing relative performance numbers. Solaris gets beat in 32-bit mode, but edges out Linux in 64-bit mode on identical hardware. AND, we've got a bunch more x86-64 performance through the pipeline. This benchmark is just in one _very_ specific area of the system, but it's exciting nonetheless.
