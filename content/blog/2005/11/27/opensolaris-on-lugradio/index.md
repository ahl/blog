The good folks over at [LugRadio](http://www.lugradio.org) (that [LUG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_User_Group); not the other [LUG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian_until_graduation) of course) invited me on their show to answer some of their questions about [OpenSolaris](http://opensolaris.org). You can find it in the [latest episode](http://www.lugradio.org/episodes/38). Check your volume before you start playing the episode: the first reference to masturbation is approximately 6 seconds in.

Understandably, the LugRadio guys didn't have much exposure to OpenSolaris, but they were certainly interested and recognize that it represents a pretty exciting development in the world of open source. Mostly I addressed some of the differences between Solaris and Linux. They seemed quite keen on [Nexenta](http://www.gnusolaris.org/gswiki) and I recommend that Solaris and Debian users alike try it out. There's one small correction I'd like to make regarding my comments on the show: I erroneously claimed that Solaris 7 -- the first version of Solaris to support 64-bit processors -- came out in 1996. In fact, Solaris 7 came out in November of 1998 (64-bit support having been first integrated in October of 1997). That cuts our 64-bit experience to 7 or 8 years from the 10 that I claimed.

On a vaguely related note, I'll be in London speaking at the [OpenSolaris user group](http://ccgi.ulfandreasson.plus.com/blogs/ulf/index.php?title=london_opensolaris_user_group_losug_xmas&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1) meeting on 12/19/2005. That's after a tromp accross Europe which includes a [DTrace cum Java](http://wiki.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP05/DTrace) talk and an [OpenSolaris BoF](http://wiki.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP05/Java+and+OpenSolaris) at [JavaPolis](http://wiki.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP05/Home) in Belgium.
