Something kind of crazy is going on. I got a call from [Chris](http://blogs.sun.com/chrisra); "Check out what we're going to do at JavaOne," he said. Here's the deal: come to [JavaOne](http://java.sun.com/javaone), bring your Java application (on a usb device or CD or whatever), and we'll[\[1\]](#some_val) improve your application using DTrace. Or you get a free tchotchke -- possibly one of several iPods. Usually you only see this kind of offer at furniture stores, and there's some catch, but this is the real deal: either your application goes faster because of our clever DTrace trickery or you're up some whizzy gadget. I was dubious until I saw the [official announcement](http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/javaone_challenge.jsp).

On the subject of JavaOne, this seems as good a time as any to plug the [session](https://www28.cplan.com/javaone05_93_1/session_details.jsp?isid=273210&ilocation_id=93-1&ilanguage=english) I'm giving on Thursday at 1:15pm in Room 121/122 (TS-5211). I'll be talking about the same [technology](https://solaris10-dtrace-vm-agents.dev.java.net/) we're (apparently) going to be using on your application.

See you at JavaOne; bring your app.

\[1\] For some value of the term _we_ -- I'm guessing _I_ am going to be party to this insanity...
