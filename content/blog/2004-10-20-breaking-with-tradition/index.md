## The Red Sox Are Going To The World Series!!

**Post World Series Update:** It has been an amazing and unexpected elation I've carried with me this past week since the Sox won their first world series in my and my father's lifetimes. My grandfather was born in 1919 -- we would have loved to have seen this. Some of my earliest memories are of watching the Red Sox on my dad's lap and the 1986 world series is the only time I can remember him shedding a tear. When the Sox were [down 3-0 to the hated Yankees](http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/10/17/red_sox_on_brink_of_elimination_as_yanks_pound_them_19_8/) in the ALCS, I was crushed. I pledged not to watch games 4 and 5 because I was so emotionally invested in the game that watching them lose would be too painful and watching them win would just be a reminder of the impossibly high mountain they still had left to climb.

When [Lowe pitched a brilliant game 7](http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/10/21/its_the_high_point_for_lowe/) to seal their [historic come back](http://cache.boston.com/sports/special/redsox/2004alcs/globepages/page1_102104.jpg), I was amazing and delighted (and that's to say nothing of the heroic efforts of [Shilling](http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/10/20/magnificent_schilling_gave_them_a_strong_foothold/) and [Pedro](http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/10/27/he_gave_command_performance/)), but nothing compared to that moment with Foulke underhanded Renteria's gounder to Doug Mientkiewicz and the entirety of Red Sox nation [began the celebration](http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/10/31/joy_knows_no_bounds/).
