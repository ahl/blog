This week it was my pleasure to welcome my former Sun colleague Matt Ahrens and George Wilson to [Delphix](http://www.delphix.com). Matt and I studied computer science together at Brown and then joined Sun in 2001. Matt joined [Jeff Bonwick](http://blogs.sun.com/bonwick/entry/and_now_page_2) to start ZFS while I worked on [DTrace](http://wikis.sun.com/display/DTrace/DTrace). George joined Sun in 1996, and worked in a variety of roles, joining the ZFS team in 2006 (just as I was leaving to help start [Fishworks](http://blogs.sun.com/fishworks)).

George and Matt bring an amazing knowledge of ZFS — the lower, and upper halves respectively — and are also just great engineers who are already contributing tangibly to the the success of Delphix. You can take a look at Matt's [old blog](http://blogs.sun.com/ahrens/), or watch George in a [bunch of videos](http://blogs.sun.com/storage/entry/oracle_solaris_storage_in_video) (including one of him being [interviewed by a muppet](http://blogs.sun.com/video/entry/jack_adams_interviews_george_wilson)).
