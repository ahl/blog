At the Flash Memory Summit today, Sun's own Michael Cornwell delivered a [keynote excoriating the overall direction of NAND flash and SSDs](http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=219200284). In particular, he spoke of the "lithography death march" as NAND vendors push to deliver the most cost-efficient solution while making huge sacrifices in reliability and performance.

On Wednesday, August 12, I'll be giving two short talks as part of sessions on flash-enabled power savings and data center applications:

- 8:30 - 9:45 [Power Saving Architectures Enabled by Smarter Software](http://dtrace.org/resources/ahl/fms09_leventhal_power.pdf)
- 3:15 - 4:30 [The Need For Higher-Level Software for Flash](http://dtrace.org/resources/ahl/fms09_leventhal_software.pdf)

In the evening from 7:30 to 9:00, I'll be hosting a table discussion of software as it pertains to flash. We'll be talking about uses of flash such as the [Hybrid Storage Pool](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/hybrid_storage_pools_in_cacm), how software can enable the use of MLC flash in the enterprise, the role of the flash translation layer, and anything else that comes up.
