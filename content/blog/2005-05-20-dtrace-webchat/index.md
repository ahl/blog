A colleague pointed me to a recent [online seminar](http://www.snpnet.com/sun_DTrace/dtrace.html) given on the topic of DTrace. If you've been meaning to crack the Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide to get started with DTrace, but are more of a, um, passive learner, this might be a nice way to get started.
