Two members of the ZFS team have joined the blogging fray. Check out [Matt Ahrens](http://blogs.sun.com/ahrens)'s and [Val Henson](http://blogs.sun.com/val)'s weblogs.

For the unintiated, ZFS is the brand new file system that's going to be in Solaris 10. ZFS is _incredibly_ fast, reliable, and easy to manage. I recently moved my home directory from out UFS file server to an experimental ZFS file server. Opening my (extensive) mail spool went from 20 seconds to 3; doing an ls(1) sped up by more than a factor of two in my home directory; and the repository of crash dumps I keep went from 40G to 4G. This is _really_ cool technology both under the hood and from the point of view of users and administrators -- stay tuned to their weblogs for all the details.
