[go to the Solaris 10 top 11-20 list for more](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/the_solaris_10_top_11)

[Eric Schrock](http://blogs.sun.com/eschrock) has an [overview of watchpoints](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/eschrock/20040713#watchpoints_101) as well as a [discussion of the cool improvements](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/eschrock/20040717#watchpoints_features_in_solaris_10) he's made to watchpoints in Solaris 10. Watchpoints have, in the past, been a bit dodgy -- they were only vaguely compatible with C++, multi-threaded code, and x86 stacks. Now they're way more robust and much faster.
