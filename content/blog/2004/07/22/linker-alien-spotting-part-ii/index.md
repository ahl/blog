Another [linker alien](http://blogs.sun.com/rie) has joing the b.s.c. fray. [Mike Walker](http://blogs.sun.com/msw) already has some useful stuff about shared libraries that you should [check out](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/msw/20040722#title_how_to_build_a). If you have linker questions, do what I do: ask Mike.
