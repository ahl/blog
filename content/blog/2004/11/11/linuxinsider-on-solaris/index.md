Check out LinuxInsider's [article on Solaris 10](http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/The-Importance-of-Solaris-10-37993.html). In particular, the last paragraph has high praise for Solaris 10 and Sun's forthcoming hardware ventures:

> _Bring them together in production systems and what do you get? The ability to organize your business around a single physical computer redundantly implemented in processors spread across your network -- meaning that a lot of business processes now limited by technology costs and software complexity can be simplified right down to affordability. That's what Solaris 10 is really about, and the 10-year impact is likely to be like nothing we've seen before._

Come [Monday](http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/story/0,10801,97097,00.html?from=story_picks), I hope to see similar thoughtful analysis coming from other publications.
