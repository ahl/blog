[Ian Murdock](http://ianmurdock.com/about) has [left the Linux Foundation to lead the operating systems strategy here at Sun](http://ianmurdock.com/2007/03/19/joining-sun). The last few years have seen some exciting changes at Sun: releasing [Solaris 10](http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/) (which includes several truly revolutionary technologies), embracing x86, [leading on x64](http://www.channelinsider.com/article/Sun+Burns+Brightest+in+Latest+IDC+Server+Study/201913_1.aspx), and taking Solaris open source. That a luminary of the Linux world was enticed by the changes we've made and the technologies we're creating is a huge vote of confidence. From my (admittedly biased) view, [OpenSolaris](http://opensolaris.org) has been breaking away from the pack with technologies like DTrace, ZFS, Zones, SMF, FMA and others. I'm looking forward to the contributions Ian will bring from his [experience with Debian](http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/murdockint.html), and to the wake-up call this may be to Linux devotees: OpenSolaris is breaking away.
