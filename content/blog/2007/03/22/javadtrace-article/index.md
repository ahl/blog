[The Texas Ranger](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace/blogs/jarod/) himself, Jarod Jenson, has written a [nice article](http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/33943) about using the [new DTrace probes in Java SE 6](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/vm/dtrace.html). If that's up your alley, you should come to [the talk](http://www28.cplan.com/cc158/session_details.jsp?isid=286698&ilocation_id=158-1&ilanguage=english) Jarod and I will be giving at JavaOne in May. We'll be talking about some of the new features in Java SE 6 and potentially previewing some new features slated for Java SE 7. This will be our [third](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/javaone_dtrace_session_2006) [year](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/dtrace_presentation_at_javaone) [at JavaOne](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/dtrace_in_the_javaone_keynote) -- it's great to see how much progress we're making each year.
