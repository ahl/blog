This week I'll be in Amsterdam attending and speaking at [Euro OSCON](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/). I'll be running [a session](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/eurooscon/view/e_sess/7933) on [DTrace](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/) on Thursday at 1:30. For the uninitiated, DTrace is the systemic observability framework in OpenSolaris that allows for tracing of the kernel and applications on production systems. At OSCON in Portland, [Bryan](http://blogs.sun.com/bmc) and [Wez](http://netevil.org/) extended [DTrace into php](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bmc?entry=dtrace_and_php) (it already worked on C/C++ and [Java](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/dtracing_java)); since then, the DTrace community has extended DTrace into [Ruby](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bmc?entry=dtrace_and_ruby) and [Perl](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/alanbur?entry=dtrace_and_perl) -- we'll see if we can come up with something new this week.

I'll also be tagging in on the [OpenSolaris Users' Group Meeting](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/eurooscon/view/e_sess/7964) and the [OpenSolaris Technologies BoF](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/eurooscon/view/e_sess/7934) along with [Casper](/casper), [Alan](/alanbur), [Patrick](/patrickf), [Simon](/webmink), and others.

I've had a bit of a chance to explore Amsterdam a bit and it's spectacular. My California-thinned blood won't let me forgo a comment on the rather cold weather, but my Northeastern upbringing won't let me complain too loudly.
