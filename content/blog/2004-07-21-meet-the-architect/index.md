Corporate shill that I am, there's now a [little article I wrote](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/meet_architects.html#leventhal) on the [meet the architects page](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/meet_architects.html). The DTrace team already has a column as a group, but in this one I focus on application tracing which was my primary contribution to DTrace.
